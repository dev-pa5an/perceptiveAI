# Depth Detection with RGB Images and Depth Cameras Using Semantic Segmentation in Computer Vision

The key twist is using a specific type of neural network called a "semantic segmentation network" to improve the accuracy. This network learns to categorize different parts of the image (like walls, furniture, people) and uses that information to estimate the average depth to those objects.
